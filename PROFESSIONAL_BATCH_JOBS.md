## 1. End-of-Day (EOD) Reconciliation Job

### Purpose
Validates that all day's transactions have been properly recorded and the account balance reconciles correctly. This is a critical control process required for regulatory compliance and audit purposes.

### Business Logic
- Reads opening balance from the data store
- Processes all transactions for the day
- Calculates expected closing balance (opening + credits - debits)
- Compares calculated balance with actual closing balance
- Flags any discrepancies for investigation
- Generates comprehensive reconciliation report

### Input File Format: `eod_transactions.dat`

**Fixed-width format (53 characters per record):**
```
Position  Length  Field           Description
1-8       8       Transaction Date YYYYMMDD format
9-14      6       Transaction Time HHMMSS format
15-20     6       Transaction Type CREDIT or DEBIT (padded)
21-30     10      Amount          Format: 9(8)V99 (no decimal point)
31-45     15      Reference       Transaction reference number
46-55     10      Channel         Transaction channel/source
```

**Example Record:**
```
20241021083015CREDIT00025000TXN20241021001ATM-DEPOSIT
```
This represents: October 21, 2024 at 08:30:15, CREDIT of $250.00, reference TXN20241021001, via ATM-DEPOSIT

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
cobc -x eod-reconciliation.cob data.cob -o eod-reconciliation
./eod-reconciliation
```

### Output Reports

**eod_reconciliation_report.txt** - Comprehensive reconciliation report including:
- Balance reconciliation (opening, credits, debits, closing)
- Reconciliation status (BALANCED or OUT OF BALANCE)
- Transaction statistics (counts by type)
- Transaction analysis (largest credit/debit)

**eod_errors.log** - Error log for invalid transactions

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Total transactions processed
- Credit transaction count and total
- Debit transaction count and total
- Largest credit and debit transactions
- Balance difference (if any)
- Error count

### Real-World Usage
This job would typically run automatically at the end of each business day (e.g., 11:59 PM) as part of the bank's daily closing procedures. Any out-of-balance conditions would trigger alerts to operations staff for immediate investigation.

## 2. Interest Calculation Job

### Purpose
Calculates daily interest accrual on deposit accounts based on tiered interest rates. Interest is calculated daily but typically posted to accounts monthly. This is a standard banking practice for savings and interest-bearing checking accounts.

### Business Logic
- Uses tiered interest rate structure based on account balance
- Calculates daily interest using formula: Balance × (Annual Rate / 365)
- Only processes accounts meeting minimum balance requirements
- Generates posting records for later batch posting
- Provides detailed calculation report for audit purposes

### Interest Rate Tiers
| Tier | Balance Range | Annual Rate (APY) |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | $0 - $999.99 | 0.50% |
| 2 | $1,000 - $9,999.99 | 1.50% |
| 3 | $10,000 - $99,999.99 | 2.50% |
| 4 | $100,000+ | 3.50% |

**Minimum Balance for Interest:** $100.00

### Input File Format: `account_balances.dat`

**Fixed-width format (54 characters per record):**
```
Position  Length  Field              Description
1-12      12      Account Number     Unique account identifier
13-20     8       Account Type       CHECKING or SAVINGS
21-32     12      Current Balance    Format: S9(10)V99 (signed, no decimal)
33-44     12      Minimum Balance    Format: 9(10)V99 (no decimal)
45-52     8       Last Interest Date YYYYMMDD format
```

**Example Record:**
```
ACC100000001CHECKING000142550000010000020241015
```
This represents: Account ACC100000001, CHECKING type, balance $1,425.50, minimum balance $100.00, last interest date 10/15/2024

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
cobc -x interest-calculation.cob data.cob -o interest-calculation
./interest-calculation
```

### Output Files

**interest_calculation_report.txt** - Detailed report including:
- Interest rate tier schedule
- Calculation summary (accounts processed, eligible accounts)
- Total account balances and total interest calculated

**interest_postings.dat** - Machine-readable file containing interest amounts to be posted to accounts

### Calculation Example
For an account with balance $5,000.00 in Tier 2 (1.50% APY):
- Daily Rate = 1.50% / 365 = 0.00411%
- Daily Interest = $5,000.00 × 0.00411% = $0.21 (rounded)
- Monthly Interest (30 days) = $0.21 × 30 = $6.30

### Real-World Usage
This job runs daily (typically overnight) to calculate interest accrual. The interest_postings.dat file is used by a subsequent batch job to actually post the interest to accounts, usually on the last day of the month. This separation allows for review and approval before posting.

## 4. Overdraft Processing Job

### Purpose
Identifies accounts with negative balances, calculates appropriate fees, generates customer notices, and creates fee posting records. This is a critical revenue and risk management function for banks.

### Business Logic
- Scans all accounts for negative balances
- Calculates overdraft fees based on fee schedule
- Assesses additional daily fees for extended overdrafts
- Generates customer notices for immediate attention
- Creates fee posting records for accounting
- Produces management report for collections department

### Fee Schedule
- **Overdraft Fee (per occurrence):** $35.00
- **Daily Overdraft Fee:** $5.00 per day
- **Maximum Daily Fees:** 10 days (capped at $50.00 additional)
- **Total Maximum Fee:** $85.00 per overdraft occurrence

### Fee Calculation Logic
1. **First Overdraft:** $35.00 base fee
2. **Extended Overdraft:** $5.00 per day for each day account remains negative
3. **Fee Cap:** Daily fees capped at 10 days maximum
4. **Example:** Account overdrawn for 3 days = $35.00 + ($5.00 × 3) = $50.00

### Input File Format: `account_balances.dat`

Same format as Interest Calculation job (see above). The key difference is that this job looks for negative (overdrawn) balances indicated by a minus sign in the balance field.

**Example Overdrawn Account:**
```
ACC100000005CHECKING-00025000000000000020241020
```
This represents: Account ACC100000005, CHECKING type, balance -$250.00 (overdrawn), last overdraft date 10/20/2024

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
cobc -x overdraft-processing.cob data.cob -o overdraft-processing
./overdraft-processing
```

### Output Files

- Fee schedule
- List of all overdrawn accounts with balances and fees
- Processing summary (accounts reviewed, overdraft count, total fees)

**overdraft_notices.txt** - Customer notices including:
- Account number and date

### Customer Notice Content
Each notice includes:
- Clear identification of overdraft situation
- Current negative balance amount
- Fee amount being assessed
- Urgency message to deposit funds
- Warning about additional fees
- Contact information for customer service

### Real-World Usage
This job typically runs daily (often multiple times per day) to quickly identify and address overdraft situations. Early detection helps minimize losses and allows the bank to contact customers promptly. The notices can be sent via mail, email, or SMS depending on customer preferences.

### Risk Management
The overdraft report helps the collections department:
- Prioritize accounts for follow-up
- Identify chronic overdraft accounts
- Monitor total exposure
- Make decisions about account restrictions or closures
